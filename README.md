### Disclaimer  

Some of these files date back to 2006ish when I got introduced to Gentoo/kBSD,
and they've followed me on FreeBSD 6, OpenSolaris, OpenIndiana, Debian, and
Arch. Memories aside, this means some of these files date back to when I had
close to no idea how a \*nix OS worked, and although I sometimes update the
components I use more often some are just... Bad. But hey, they work! And
somehow procrastinationd always starts up when I'm sorta in the mood to take
a look at certain files.  
To be completely honest some files started off from what the person who
introduced me to the \*nix world was using at the time.  

TL;DR: I should probably feel ashamed and rewrite some of these files (most
notably the ones within zsh folder), but it probably won't happen anytime
soon.
